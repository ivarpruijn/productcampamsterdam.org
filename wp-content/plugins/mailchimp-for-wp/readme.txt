== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =
This plugin gives you the possibility to easily create a sign-up form and show this form in various places on your website. Also, this plugin can add a checkbox to your comment form that makes it easy for commenters to subscribe to your MailChimp newsletter. All they have to do is check one checkbox and they will be added to your mailinglist(s).

For a complete list of plugin features, take a look here: [MailChimp for WordPress](http://dannyvankooten.com/wordpress-plugins/mailchimp-for-wordpress/).

= Why does the checkbox not show up at my comment form? =
Your theme probably does not support the necessary comment hook this plugin uses to add the checkbox to your comment form. You can manually place the checkbox by placing the following code snippet inside the form tags of your theme's comment form.
 `<?php if(function_exists('mc4wp_show_checkbox')) { mc4wp_show_checkbox(); }?>`
 Your theme folder can be found by browsing to `/wp-content/themes/your-theme-name/`.

= Where can I find my MailChimp API key? =
[http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/where-can-i-find-my-api-key](http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/where-can-i-find-my-api-key)

= How can I style the sign-up form? =
You can use the following CSS selectors to style the sign-up form to your likings. Just add your CSS rules to your theme's stylesheet, usually found in `/wp-content/themes/your-theme-name/style.css`.

`
form.mc4wp-form{ ... } /* the form element */
form.mc4wp-form p { ... } /* form paragraphs */
form.mc4wp-form label { ... } /* labels */
form.mc4wp-form input { ... } /* input fields */
form.mc4wp-form input[type=submit] { ... } /* submit button */
form.mc4wp-form p.alert { ... } /* success & error messages */
form.mc4wp-form p.success { ... } /* success message */
form.mc4wp-form p.error { ... } /* error messages */
` 

= The shortcode [mc4wp-form] is not working. Why? =
Make sure to go to **form settings** in the plugin settings screen. There you have to check a checkbox that says "load form functionality". This will make the plugin load the necessary code.

= Can I add a checkbox to this form by plugin ...? =
Yes, you can. Go to checkbox and tick the checkbox that says "show checkbox at other forms (manual)". Then, include ANY field with name attribute `mc4wp-do-subscribe` and the plugin will take care of the rest. 

Example: 
`<input type="checkbox" name="mc4wp-do-subscribe" value="1" id="mc4wp-checkbox" /><label for="mc4wp-checkbox">Subscribe to our newsletter</label>`.

Make sure your form contains an email field with any of the following names: 
`email, e-mail, emailaddress, user_email, your-email, your_email, signup_email, emailadres` 

Note: when using Contact Form 7 you can use "[mc4wp_checkbox]" inside your CF7 form template.

= How do I add subscribers to certain interest groups? =
The following snippet should get you started.

`<input type="hidden" name="GROUPINGS[0][id]" value="INSERT GROUPING ID HERE" />
<input type="hidden" name="GROUPINGS[0][groups]" value="INSERT GROUPING GROUP ID'S HERE (SEPARATED BY COMMA)" />`

Alternatively, update to [MailChimp for WP Pro](#coming-soon) where you can manage interest groups from the settings screen.
